# Movies WebApp

✔This is a movies web app where I've utilized React Router DOM for routing purposes. 



✔This application includes a form component provided by React Router DOM. 



✔To fetch movie data from the OMDB API, I've implemented a loader function, which returns data fetched from the API. To handle the data returned by the loader function, I've utilized the useLoaderData hook.



✔While fetching movies, I've employed the Axios library, although I typically use the Fetch API for such tasks. 



✔Additionally, I've used the Link component from React Router DOM to create links within the application. For error handling, I've implemented the useRouterError hook and utilized a try-catch block.



✔To search for movies, I've incorporated search parameters to facilitate GET requests, allowing users to find specific movies. 



✔and to manage loading states i used useNavigation hook that give me an object from that i can check the loading states .
